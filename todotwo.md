# A simple list of things to do and order in which to do them.
*Note: This may or may not replace the other todo list.*
## Short Term Goals
- [X] Create the sun, known as sol.
- [X] Create a new system for allowing moons to be defined relative to the planets they orbit.
- [ ] Add the moons of jupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune.
- [ ] Create a list of ideas for new star systems and challenges.

## Medium Term Goals
- [ ] Make custom surface generation to planets
- [ ] Create a new "Solar System Edge" from which interstellar travel can be initiated. The original solar system edge can be renamed to "The Promethium Line" past which promethium spawns.
- [ ] Create systems for interstellar travel, such as warp drive and high-energy matter antimatter reactors.
- [ ] Slow down the movement of the starry background, such that it only seems to move at FTL speeds.
- [ ] Create the oort cloud, the first interstellar destination after reaching the Solar System Edge.
- [ ] Develop a new star system which requires interstellar travel to be reached.

## Long Term Goals
- [ ] Add a reason to go to the solar system instead of just using the existing SA planets.
- [ ] Create new science packs, challenges and technologies.
- [ ] Release from an early access state, or whatever we're calling the current phase of development.
